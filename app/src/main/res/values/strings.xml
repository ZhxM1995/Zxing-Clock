    <string name="about_content"><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, when I first started my professional journey, my initial learning project was a clock application. Unfortunately, in 2024, I lost the original clock app when I replaced my test device. Inspired by this, I decided to re-implement and optimize the clock application, naming it <b>Zxing Clock</b>.</p><p>The <b>Zxing Clock</b> application was developed out of pure interest and with heartfelt thanks to <b>Wu Hui</b> for their invaluable interaction support.</p><p>You can find the project on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/ZhxM1995/Zxing-Clock">https://github.com/ZhxM1995/Zxing-Clock</a>.
